    <h1>Dinosaurs r so scary</h1>
      </div>

    Hello World
   <p id="pinkparagraph"> Alright, here’s the deal
     — if you want *scary* dinosaurs, you need the
      ones that looked like nature’s glitch.
       Picture massive predators slicing through ancient
        forests like they owned the place. T. rex wasn’t
         just big; it was a walking pressure washer of
          teeth that could turn anything into paste in one bite.
           Utahraptors? Don’t let Jurassic Park fool you — these
            things were basically turbo-charged murder birds with
            knife-sized claws and zero patience. And then you’ve got
             things like Giganotosaurus, which was basically T.
              rex on “I skipped therapy for too long” mode.
               The prehistoric world wasn’t cute — it was a full-time horror
                movie with reptiles that could outrun you, out-bite you,
                 and absolutely ruin your Tuesday.</p>

<h2 class="ugly"> Dinosaurs r also veyr cool</h2>
<p>Dinosaurs weren’t just cool — they were absolute
     monsters of the planet in the best way possible. 
     Giant lizards bigger than buses, shredding each
      other with claws the size of kitchen knives,
       walking around like they owned every inch of Earth… 
       because they basically did. Some had armor like tanks,
        some had necks longer than your car, some could outrun
         you, your friends, and your entire hockey team combined.
          They were wild, terrifying, ridiculous, and completely 
          unbeatable — the closest thing this planet has ever had
           to real-life dragons.</p>

<h3>Why are the chasing me ???</h3>

<h4>look at how long those teeth are!!</h4>

<p>
Dinosaurs weren’t just cool, they were the ultimate flex of nature.
 Giant tanks with teeth, claws, armor plates, and necks longer than
  your whole house. Some sprinted faster than most cars, some shook
   the ground when they walked, and some were basically walking fortresses. 
   They ruled the planet for *millions* of years, no drama, no weakness — 
   just pure survival dominance. Honestly, everything alive today is the
    watered-down sequel.</p>

    scary things about dinosaurs:
    <ul>
<li class="pretty">run fast</li>
<li class="pretty">they are very strong</li>
<li>they lived thousands of years ago</li>
</ul>

<p class="common footer"> 
Back in the dinosaur age, everything felt like it was designed specifically
 to kill you. Some of these monsters didn’t just hunt — they bullied the entire planet.
  Spinosaurus stomped around with a crocodile skull the size of your torso and claws built
   like can-openers. Carnotaurus looked like a demon someone sketched during a nightmare,
    all horns and speed and probably bad intentions. Even the smaller ones were terrifying:
     packs of raptors slicing through anything dumb enough to wander alone. The whole era
      was just an ecosystem of oversized lizards built to chase, bite, and shred anything
       that breathed. If you were alive back then? You wouldn’t be “exploring” — you’d be
        sprinting for your life every morning.</p>
